# Development snapshot — not execution admission

User requested ending continuous development/polling and an hourly monitoring cadence. No background wake-up or app automation was configured. The last observed job status is PREFIX 1737594 PENDING at 2026-11-13 15:47 UTC; the next proposed observation at 16:47 UTC has not occurred. Slurm continues independently. Do not resubmit, cancel, or retry an unknown attempt.

The user explicitly approved the complete four-step training risk interpretation, using 384 conflict responses per window. The immutable clarification is `intake/TRAIN_RISK_CLARIFICATION_20261114.json`; bind it before any TRAIN generation. Public push authorization remains valid.

New local components, not deployed:

- `analysis/evaluation.py`: complete-endpoint CPU evidence/scoring, 17 targeted tests passed using pinned native/legacy scoring. Does not grant MAIN release or training admission.
- `execution/canary_audit.py`: independent four-path evidence audit and frozen-weight fingerprints. Synthetic CPU fixtures do not demonstrate actual GPU canary or process termination.
- `execution/evaluation_runtime.py`: WIP, syntax checked only; no behavior/integration tests yet. Do not deploy or execute models with it. BEGIN/native capture wiring, source identity transitions, authority guards, no-retry and RNG preservation still require tests and review.

Existing deployed GPU release eff7036 and PREFIX release 734e921 remain unchanged. Do not create TECHNICAL_EXECUTION_BINDING until both complete PREFIX start gates pass. No actual GPU admission, TRAIN, DEV or MAIN has been performed.

On resumption: read latest ADMISSION_REPORT and job receipts, perform a read-only queue/attempt audit, preserve frozen samples/seeds/gates, and only then continue authorized dependent work. The local monitor helper is `/private/tmp/satdose_monitor_prefix_short.py`; it performs read-only SSH observations and saves a local timestamped receipt. It is not a scheduler.

Still required before TRAIN: concrete authenticated admission, actual GPU checks and independent audit, full immutable training release/controllers and source bindings, explicit storage budgets, initial DEV, first-two-step/canary process supervision and four-path evidence, source-bound risk handling. MAIN remains sealed until all four true step24 chains complete without HOLD/UNKNOWN and terminal authority validates them.

Bounded independent static review found no credentials or dangerous default activation; syntax checks passed. Canary targeted tests: 11 passed (95.101 seconds), using synthetic GPU/process evidence and actual small CPU Adam states. Evaluation runtime still has no behavior test coverage. See intake/DEVELOPMENT_SNAPSHOT_REVIEW_20261114.json.

Final stable full CPU suite: 348 tests passed, zero skips, 249.158 seconds. Log: intake/development_snapshot_cpu_tests_20261114.log. This does not cover evaluation_runtime behavior/integration or actual GPU execution.
